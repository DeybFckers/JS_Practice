declare what kind of datatypes, which is String, number, bool)
but theres only three you can declare datatypes in js 
which is let, const and var, let datatypes it means you can
change the value by reusing the variable or redeclaread the of variable
but you can't redeclare the variable, const datatypes you can't change 
the value and redeclare the variable, var datatypes can be redeclared*/
